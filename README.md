# 👋 Hello coders, I'm Marcello Pagano
🖥️ Hi, my name is Marcello Pagano and I am a computer technician (ICT) with more than twenty years of experience in Microsoft Windows systems, my skills also concern desktop/laptop hardware interventions.

🌐 Since 2015 I have been passionate about programming related to the web world, after a brief experience with php I immediately became interested in everything related to the javascript world.

📖 The study of JavaScript consequently brought me to know technologies such as: Node, MySQL, MongoDb and TypeScript.
